<h1 align="center">The "Hangman" Game</h1>

## Purpose

The "Hangman" Game started off as a medium for [me](http://www.atagowani.com) to learn and practice AngularJS. After seeing the joy my students got while playing the game, it turned into a game for the students to play during their break and something to help them master the spelling of words and even, at times, learn new ones. The game now lives somewhere in between.

## Running it locally

### Setup ###

**Clone** by running `git clone https://github.com/AtaGowani/hangman`

**Get all the dependecies** by running `npm i` in the root of the repo's directory

Now `open index.html` and see the game locally.

This project uses **Webpack** as a build tool.

If you make changes to the files (CSS and JS) in `src`, these changes won't be visible until you run `npm run build` which will call Webpack and build the changes in the `dist` folder.
